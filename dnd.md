# DND Notes
  
### *October 22*
<hr>

Jake, Sean and Nomire go to Dano to offer assistance in any way. The goal is to further understand their plans. Dano
fills them in on a troubling situation happening with one of their trade routes. Dano and the rest of the underdark
town had an agreement to trade alchemical resources in exchange for magical weapons/items and gold. The other traders
were magical humans known to reside on the other side of a system of tunnels.

Mitch and Jason decide to search for Dontell and his group of mercenaries. After a poor performance, Mitch conjures
a lie that he knows where a powerful artifact lies. Dontell's second in command, Donmor, hears this and,unsure if
this is true but not taking any chances, brings Mitch and Jason face to face with Dontell. Dontell informs the two
that the orb of chaos in somewhere within the underdark and that the town council would probably also be in search of
it.

We leave without addressing where Teddy is, almost as if there's an unspoken grudge. Two of the town guardsmen grab
their bows and join our mission.

Shortly after starting our journey, we encountered an abandoned trade wagon on the side of the road. We could make out
signs that it was attacked. We start to spread out to investigate. An invisible force attacks Jason and Mitch and both 
take heavy damage. The two also notice that their coin pouches are significantly lighter.

Jake decides to cast _detect_good_and_evil_ and he sees a few ghostly pale white humanoid women. The creatures have their limbs
covered with eyes pitch black like the night sky. He surmises that they must be able to detect gold in order to consume it.
Perhaps this is how they survive.

After some solid teamwork, the creatures are defeated and each turns to black goo. Then, they are absorbed by the earth beneath our 
feet. We heal up with a few potions and continue on to a large cavern. We suspect that the spiders we're looking for likely
reside here due to all the webs and cocoons. We decide instead of trying to fight the spiders, why don't we try to persuade
them. We talk with them and to our surprise the spiders understand the common tongue. Eventually, we make a deal to allow 
Dano and his crew to pass through unharmed and in return sacrifices must be given to the spiders. As we all know, the best sacrifices are
our enemies.

We make it out of the cave and continue on our path. In the distance, we see a small town with a looming tower in near
the center of the town. As we approach, the wind picks up as if a storm is approaching. After a couple minutes, a thunderstorm
rolls in; however, there is no rain to accompany it. The sky changes colors to red and violet as the storm thunders on. The
view is both beautiful and terrifying. Looking up at the tower, we notice that the top has collapsed - likely due to an 
explosion. Above the rubble at the apex of the tower, we see debris floating around in the shape of a sphere.

As we approach the front gate to the town, the wind speed starts to pick up. 

> This storm is likely caused by magic

someone yells; however, no one can hear him over the raging winds.

> What did you say?

yells another, to no avail. As we enter the town, we see buildings that all have pieces of their structure removed in a clean fashion.
After investigating the town for a bit, we suspect that a botched teleportation spell caused the missing structures of all the buildings.
Likely, an implosion occurred at the top of the tower and roofs and sidings were drawn into it, creating a tear in space.

We regroup and notice that Nomire is nowhere to be found. We suspect he went ahead to the mage tower already. As the group enters
the tower and climbs the stairs, we hear movement on the floor above. We send one of the archers up to check it out. We yell out
to him... no response.... The rest of the group follows him up and arrows fly across the room from all different directions. The arrows
hit Mitchell and the second archer who stayed behind, knocking them unconscious and leaving them poisoned.

Jason performs a critical counter-attack and redirects one of the arrows back to who shot it. A loud cracking noise is audible 
as the arrow pierces the enemies' skull. Jake rushes along an edge and brutally kills a tiny dark elf. The others are horrified, 
once again, as Jake decapitates his victim and stores the head in his _bag of holding_. The enemies have relatively we defense,
so we take care of them with little effort. With a couple remaining, Sean decides to wake Mitchell up and grabs the body of 
one of the dead archers to use as a shield.

At that moment, a dark figure crashes through the ceiling and introduces himself as _Kol_, a follower of _Lord O_. Nomire appears 
struggling at his feet. He mentions how pathetic and annoying our group is. He then turns to Mitch to remind him that he still
holds his soul and that he's clearly not taking Kol's threat seriously enough.

He then gives Nomire a swift kick to the face, knocking him unconscious, slams his staff that is adorned with snake heads at 
the top. The eyes of the snake heads begin to glow. Nomires physical body along with the remaining 8 drow are absorbed by the 
staff. A small red sphere begins to descend from the staff - Nomire's soul - and it violently begins to shake and unfold into 
a large undead humanoid with alligator-like features. Kol smirks and says,

> Have fun

and leaves.

The creature turned out to be a tough fight. Flinging boiling mud on the floor, screeching and roaring, slicing at us with 
its claws and tail. Eventually, Jake deals the final blow and collects the head of this creature.

At the top of the tower, the group enters the antigravity sphere - the giant sphere of floating debris we saw from afar. 
Jason uses his ring and is able to shift the floating debris in a way that allows us to traverse through the sphere. We find 
the orb of chaos at the end of the pathway. Mitchell picks it up and it attunes to him immediately.




### *November 5th*
<hr>

We decided to take a long rest in the Tower. We stumble across two rooms - one that has a bunch of artwork and
paintings and the other has lots of trophies of weapons. Jason sees a statue and notices some writing on it. Jason
comes back to the group and tells us. Sean and Jake go over to see if we can read it - Sean translates it to 

> Arm me to move forward

We take a long rest. When we wake up there's a magical barrier on the door to exit. Jason takes a quarterstaff and
places it in the statues hand. The weapon acts on it's on accord and slashes Jason. Jason goes to the back of the
room and sits by himself. Mitchell takes the short-sword and does the same thing as Jason - again it attacks him and
he takes a few damage. Sean does the same with the mace, and it does the same. Jake takes the sling and same thing
happened. Jason tried glaive and light hammer to no avail. Jake take the whip and places it in the statues hand and the
barrier on the door disappears.

  We journey back to Belvedere, Mitch heads to the brothel to free Teddy from his gimp suit. Mitch finds Teddy
wearing a sheep costume, blood dripping from him and gagged. Mitch removes the gag and Teddy's first words are 

> I've been a baaaaaad boy

Mitch leads Teddy out of the brothel on a leash, Teddy still acting like a sheep follows on all fours.

Sean goes to inform Dano of what happened on our journey. Dano comments that he is aware of the Dodomekis but is
surprised that three convoys didn't make it through because of them. He also tells them of the spiders that we made
a deal with - in exchange for not attacking the trade convoys the town has to give the spiders animals carcasses and
or folic prisoners. Sean tells him the bad news that there was a teleportation spell that terribly wrong and destroyed
the entire town. Dano gives Sean 500 gold and tells him he'll let him know if he has anymore missions for the group.

Next, we head to the market as a group. First, we head to an alchemy shop to buy some health potions and any other
useful potions we may need. Sean finds a back alley tattoo artist and has a magical tattoo imprinted on his arm. The
tattoo gives him a special attack power that he is now able to call upon.

We show up to Dontrell's hideout, Mitchell plans on intimidating the leader and challenging him. We see the whole
gang on criminals along with Dontrell. Dontrell asks Mitchell about the orb, Mitchell tries to attune to it and
change his face to a mask. Dontrell asks how much he would sell it for. Mitchell teleports behind Dontrell and says
that he demands control of Dontrell's operation - he can either submit or fight for control. Dontrell wasn't intimidated
and asks Mitchell what he wants control of - Mitchell says everything and a battle ensues. Once again, Mitchell fucks up the plan.

Dontrell transforms into a _green skinned warlock_. Mitchell took some damage from a surprise attack, then casts fire 
shield and teleports away towards the door. Sean sends himself into a rage then his tattoos glow as he channels fire 
into his attack. He swings his battleaxe in a sweep across the first person he sees. The axe sticks to his side. His 
next attack does critical damage and he ends up killing 3 total enemies and damages another. Teddy attacks the nearest
enemy to him with his rapier and dagger - killing the enemy. Jason runs up and attacks the closest enemy. He sends a
couple of punches then uses flurry of blows with his quarterstaff - the criminal grunt he targeted gets thrusted back 
into his ally and dies - his ally takes damage. Multiple archers shoot arrows at Mitchell and Jason - Mitchell takes 
full damage and Jason deflects the first arrow with deflect missile and takes damage. He sends the deflected arrow back 
at the enemy that shot the arrow and kills him. Jake calls upon fire to light his sword and attack the nearest enemy. With 
two slashes he kill it.

Next round, Dontrell casts a distant claw attack on Mitchell who is reduced to 0 hit points. He is revived at half
health and immune to the damage dealt due to his mask of chaos. Mitchell then casts fireball centered on the remaining
enemies in room - he kills 7 of Dontrell's minions and gains 21 temporary hit points as a result. Dontrell is now
willing to hear us out. Mitchell tells Donmor and the remaining two minions that they can join our cause but they have
to turn on their leader Dontrell. The two minions agree to help us and Donmor does not. Sean goes up to the leader and
second in command and intimidates Donmor once again to turn on his leader - Donmor states that he won't attack
Dontrell but he doesn't want to die - Donmor steps aside. Sean then attacks Dontrell, tattoo still glowing, with his
battleaxe and does a considerable amount of damage. Teddy hits Dontrell with his rapier and dagger - as a result
Dontrell is looking beat up. The two minions attack Dontrell and land the killing blow.

We demand 50% of the criminal operation and if there's an issue with the group they need to let us know, and we'll
take care of it Donmor provides a sending stone to Mitchell with unlimited range. The stone does not operate in
different planes of existence. He also provides us with their gang crest, and we give them a cloud crest of the
Atatsuki. Donmor then gives us the location of their vault and tells us that there's a magical lock on it. Before we
are able to leave, a beautiful woman appears.

She approaches Jake and casts a charm on him and greets herself as _Lovaza_. The effects of the charm
prevent him from attacking her. In a futile effort, Jake casts zone of truth. She blocks the spell. She tells Jake

> There's something you can do for me. There are two floating cities above Nalu, _Ogen_ and _Mesna_, one of which
>  holds something of great value to Jake.

The item she's looking for is a jeweled dagger that belonged to the father of the two jeweled cities floating in the sky.
The dagger is protected by a corrupted mage name _Dacogen_, who is the son of the former king of the jeweled cities.
_Dacogen_ killed his father and divided the two cities. She says she'll tell us the location of an orb in exchange for
doing this. Jake accepts the quest and Lovaza disappears.

We get drunk in the bar to celebrate the night and rest inside. The next morning we head to the outskirts of the
city to look for the vault. We come one smaller house settled in the side of a hill. The doorway blends in with the
surrounding rock. Mitchell notices that there's no magical presence on the front door. Jake opens the door while Mitchell
takes out a lock picking kit. Jake walks in with the rest of the crew, Mitchell opens the next door at the opposite side
of the room. Jake and Teddy go through, Teddy sees skeletons on the wall and water dripping from the ceiling. Mitchell
tries to dispel the magic on the door and fails. Jake decides to touch the wall and the incantation changes to say that we need a
blood offering to get through. Mitchell slits his hand and smears blood on the wall. Next, a mimic of Mitchell appears
in the room behind us, in front of Teddy, Jason and Sean.

The mimic sends a magical touch to Jason and deals necrotic damage. We're all surprised beside Jason. Jason
critically misses his first attack and the mimic of Mitchell bursts out laughing. Jason's second attack lands and
deals a moderate amount of damage. Next, he uses flurry of blows to hit the mimic two more times - dealing
considerably more damage. The mimic then teleports to the side of the room and casts a fireball on Teddy, Jason and
Sean, they all take half damage. Jake moves within range of the mimic and cast poison breath which does very little
damage. Then Jake casts sanctuary on myself as a bonus action. Mitchell casts hold person on the mimic which paralyzes
the mimic for the time being. Jason closes in and makes two attacks on the mimic which takes it's hit points to 0.
The mimic then revives with half hp and is immune to bludgeoning damage. For Jason's next attack he uses stunning
strike which paralyzes the mimic for a second time. Teddy attacked once with his rapier and dagger and deals a solid
amount of damage. Sean goes into a rage and swings his battleaxe at Mitchell's head and kills him. Sean slashes right
through him and disappears.

The door in the hallway then opens to another hallway with a door at the end. We notice
that the room is similar to the last but is now dripping a sort of ooze instead of water. Teddy perceives the skeleton
bones to be of humanoid form - the assumption is that they are dead intruders. Teddy looks for any woodland
creatures outside to no avail. Then, he tries to open the door and nothing happens. Teddy opens his mouth to drink the ooze
and throws some at the door and nothing happens. Jason finally decides to use his ring of earth and tries to manipulate the earth around
the door but that fails. Sean tries banging on the door with his hands, which makes dents and causes rocks to fall. After, Jake tries
to use dispel magic on the door unsuccessfully. Mitchell teleports to the other side on the door and sees a creature
on the other side. Jason tries to punch the door, nothing happens. Sean's tattoos start glowing and pushes the door
with radiant energy. Coincidentally the door opens as the time runs out.

The creatures casts a spell on Mitchell, as a result he is frightened and paralyzed. Then, the creatures attacks
Mitchell and deals bludgeoning damage. Jason attacks with his quarterstaff but the creature is immune to non-magical
bludgeoning damage. Jason attempts to use flurry of blows and ends up slapping himself. The creature attacks Jason
with harm and does a huge amount of damage and reduces his max hit points. Next, Jake uses his prayer beads and cast
greater restoration to free Mitchell from his paralysis. Then, he casts magic circle to enclose the mummy in a 10-foot
radius circle that gives the creature disadvantage on attack rolls. Teddy tries to talk to the mummy lord to persuade it 
to not attack us. Sean imbues his attacks with histattoo magic and deals a decent amount of damage. Mitch casts a firebolt
and also deals a considerable amount of damage. Jason backs up and leaves the room, uses wholeness of body to heal himself. 
The creature casts insect plague around itself, and deals a moderate amount of damage to everyone except Jason, Jake is the 
only one hit that takes half damage. The creature attacks Jake and misses, however, he am cursed which means his max hit points 
is reduced by 10 and continues to reduce by 10 each 24 hours. If he fails to remove the curse and die he turns to dust. Jake is
also blinded by its next move. For Jake's turn, he moves inside the cylinder, taking the attack of opportunity head on, then lights his
sword on fire and attacks the mummy lord - it ends up turning to dust. The rest of the creew notices a look of disappointment 
that he was unable to collect a new head.
